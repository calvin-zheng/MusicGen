What is Music Gen?

Music Gen is a program that is designed to take in text that a user puts in and writes on the score for them. It is to make life more convenient for music writers.
Users can also listen to the music they have wrote through two options.

What do I need to use Music Gen?

To use Music Gen, one must have Python installed on their computer and all of the files in this directory. In addition, your Python IDE will need to install port audio and PyAudio onto their computer. Do not move any of the files from their original location.

On a Mac, to install PyAudio, open Terminal. 
1. Type in brew install home-brew
2. Then when it is finished, type pip install pyaudio

On a Windows, to install PyAudio, open your console and then type: 
python -m install pyaudio
